❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a Heart Disease Prediction System built with Python, trained on a healthcare dataset using Machine Learning algorithms, and deployed via a Streamlit web application.

📌 Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction can save lives by prompting lifestyle changes or medical intervention. This ML model helps predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics.
