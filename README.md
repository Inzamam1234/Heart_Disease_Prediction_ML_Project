## 📊 Overview

Heart disease is a major public health concern, and early detection is vital for prevention and treatment. This machine learning model analyzes key indicators to determine the likelihood of heart disease in a patient.

The model takes input features like:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Max Heart Rate
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia, etc.

It predicts:
- `0` – No Heart Disease
- `1` – Likely to Have Heart Disease
